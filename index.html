				<h2>About our company</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
				<p>LF Beetz is a company whose goal it is to deliver big sound in a small, compact package. The LF Beetz speaker is the most versatile pocket-sized speaker out there. Not only only does its sound blow away that which comes from your phone's built in speakers, but it can also act as a remote shutter. This means you can set your phone down, and use your LF Beetz speaker to take a photo when you're ready, and not rely on a timer or another person who is then left out of the photo.</p>
